## 🚀 Project Overview

Skill Swap was built during a hackathon to promote **peer-to-peer learning** by creating a **matchmaking system** where users can offer a skill and request another in return.
No money involved. Just learning and growing together.

- 🔍 Skill-based search and filter
- 🤝 Skill swap request system (with accept, reject, delete options)

- 🛡️ Admin tools for moderation and analytics
